## Transfers and Currencies

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I have a transfer between accounts with different currencies (exchange rate)?">
    Yes, you can make transfers between accounts with different currencies. The system automatically applies the appropriate exchange rate for the transfer date:
    
    - The outgoing transaction uses the source account's currency and amount
    - The incoming transaction is converted to the destination account's currency using the latest available rate
    - If no exchange rate is found, it falls back to a 1:1 rate, which may result in incorrect amounts until rates are synced
    - Foreign exchange metadata is also recorded for auditing purposes
    
    For best results, make sure your exchange rates are up to date to avoid conversion errors.
