# CSV imports

Sure supports importing financial data from CSV files, making it easy to migrate from other financial apps or add bulk data.

## Supported import types

You can import the following types of data via CSV:

- **Accounts**: Create multiple accounts with opening balances
- **Transactions**: Import transaction history
- **Trades**: Import investment trades
- **Categories**: Set up your category structure
- **Rules**: Import transaction rules

## Importing accounts

Account imports let you quickly set up multiple accounts with their opening balances.

### CSV format

Your CSV file should include these columns:

| Column | Required | Description | Example |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|
| Account type | Yes | Type of account | Checking, Savings, Credit Card |
| Name | Yes | Account name | Main Checking Account |
| Balance | Yes | Opening balance | 1000.00 |
| Currency | No | Currency code (defaults to family currency) | USD |
| Balance Date | No | Date for the opening balance | 01/01/2024 |

### Example CSV

```csv
Account type,Name,Balance,Currency,Balance Date
Checking,Main Checking Account,1000.00,USD,01/01/2024
Savings,Emergency Fund,5000.00,USD,01/15/2024
Credit Card,Rewards Card,-500.00,USD,02/01/2024
```

### Balance date column

The optional **Balance Date** column lets you specify when the opening balance should be recorded. This is useful when:

- Migrating historical data from another app
- Setting up accounts with balances from a specific date
- Maintaining accurate historical balance tracking

If you don't provide a balance date, Sure will use the current date for the opening balance.

<Note>
The date format should match your import settings. Common formats include MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, and YYYY-MM-DD.

### Supported account types

- Checking
- Savings
- Credit Card
- Investment
- Loan
- Property
- Vehicle
- Crypto
- Other Asset
- Other Liability

## Importing transactions

Transaction imports let you add historical transaction data to your accounts.

### CSV format

Your CSV file should include these columns:

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Date | Yes | Transaction date |
| Amount | Yes | Transaction amount |
| Name | Yes | Transaction description |
| Account | Yes | Account name |
| Category | No | Category name |
| Notes | No | Additional notes |

### Example CSV

```csv

```

## Import process

1. **Navigate to imports**: Go to Settings → Imports or use the import button in the app
2. **Upload CSV**: Drag and drop your CSV file or click to browse
3. **Configure settings**: 
   - Select import type (Accounts, Transactions, etc.)
   - Choose date format
   - Set number format (decimal separator)
4. **Map columns**: Match your CSV columns to Sure's fields
5. **Review**: Check the preview of your data
6. **Import**: Confirm and import your data

## Tips for successful imports

1. **Use templates**: Download CSV templates from the import screen for the correct format
2. **Check encoding**: Ensure your CSV file is UTF-8 encoded
3. **Validate dates**: Make sure dates match your selected format
4. **Test with small files**: Try importing a few rows first to verify the format
5. **Clean your data**: Remove any extra columns or formatting before importing

## Troubleshooting

### Import fails with date errors

Check that your date format matches the setting you selected during import. The Balance Date column in account imports must use the same format as other date fields.

### Accounts not found

When importing transactions, ensure the account names in your CSV exactly match existing account names in Sure.

### Duplicate transactions

Sure will import all rows from your CSV. Review your data before importing to avoid duplicates.

## Limits

- **Account imports**: Maximum 50 accounts per import
- **Transaction imports**: No hard limit, but large files may take longer to process
