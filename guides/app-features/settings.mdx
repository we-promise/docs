# Settings

Sure provides various settings to customize your experience and control how the app behaves.

## Security settings

### High-resolution logos

Sure can fetch high-resolution logos for merchants and financial institutions using the Brandfetch service. This feature enhances the visual appearance of your transactions and accounts.

**To enable high-resolution logos:**

1. Navigate to Settings → Security
2. Scroll to the "Brand Fetch Settings" section
3. Toggle "Use high-resolution logos" to enable
4. The setting saves automatically

When enabled, Sure will:
- Fetch higher quality logos for merchants and institutions
- Use Brandfetch as a fallback for stock tickers when logos aren't available
- Display clearer, more professional-looking icons throughout the app

<Note>
High-resolution logos may increase data usage slightly as larger image files are downloaded.
</Note>

### Brandfetch integration

The Brandfetch integration provides:
- **High-quality logos**: Professional brand assets for better visual recognition
- **Fallback support**: Automatic logo lookup for stock tickers and merchants
- **Consistent branding**: Standardized logo appearance across all transactions

This feature works automatically once enabled - no additional configuration required.
