# Budgets

Budgets help you set spending limits for different categories and track how well you're sticking to them throughout the month.

## How Budgets Work

When you create a budget, you assign a spending limit to a category. As you spend money in that category, Sure tracks your progress and shows you:

- **Amount spent** so far this month
- **Amount remaining** in your budget
- **Status indicators** showing if you're on track, near your limit, or over budget

## Setting Up Category Budgets

Each category can have its own budget. For example, you might set:

- Food & Dining: \$500/month
- Entertainment: \$200/month
- Transportation: \$300/month

Sure shows helpful daily suggestions like "\$29.91 suggested per day for 11 remaining days" to help you pace your spending.

## Subcategories and Shared Budgets

You can organize your spending further with subcategories. For example, "Food & Dining" might include:

- Coffee & Takeout
- Groceries
- Restaurants

### Individual Budgets

Give each subcategory its own limit. This works well when you want strict control over specific types of spending.

### Shared Budgets

Leave a subcategory's budget empty to share the parent category's budget. This is great when you want flexibility across related expenses.

**Example:** Set "Food & Dining" to \$500, but leave the subcategories without individual limits. Now all your food spending draws from the same \$500 pool, whether you're buying groceries or eating out.

When a subcategory shares its parent's budget, you'll see a "(shared)" label next to the budget amount, making it clear which subcategories are drawing from the shared pool.

### Mixed Approach

Combine both methods. Set a fixed budget for some subcategories while others share the remaining amount.

**Example:**

- Food & Dining: \$500 total
- Restaurants: \$100 (fixed limit)
- Groceries and Coffee share the remaining \$400

## Status Indicators

Sure uses color-coded badges to show your budget status at a glance:

- **On Track** (green) - You're within budget and pacing well
- **Near Limit** (yellow) - Getting close to your limit
- **Over Budget** (red) - You've exceeded your budget

## Tips for Effective Budgeting

1. **Start simple** - Begin with just a few major categories before adding detail
2. **Review monthly** - Check your budgets at the end of each month and adjust as needed
3. **Use shared budgets** for categories where you want flexibility between subcategories
4. **Use individual limits** when you need strict control over specific spending
