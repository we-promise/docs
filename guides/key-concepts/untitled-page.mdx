# How Asset Accounts Work

Assets are things you own that have monetary value. In Sure, asset accounts track your wealth—from the cash in your checking account to the value of your home.

## Understanding Asset Balances

Asset account balances work intuitively:

- **Income increases your balance** (money coming in)
- **Expenses decrease your balance** (money going out)

### Example: Checking Account

Let's walk through a simple example:

| Action | Balance Change | New Balance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starting balance | — | $1,000 |
| Paycheck deposit (+$2,500) | +$2,500 | $3,500 |
| Rent payment (-$1,200) | -$1,200 | $2,300 |
| Grocery shopping (-$150) | -$150 | $2,150 |

This matches what you see in your bank account—straightforward and predictable.

## Types of Asset Accounts

Sure supports six types of asset accounts:

### Cash (Depository)

Liquid funds you can access immediately. Includes:

| Subtype | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Checking | Everyday spending account |
| Savings | Interest-bearing savings |
| HSA | Health Savings Account |
| CD | Certificate of Deposit |
| Money Market | Money market account |

### Investment

Accounts that hold securities like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Investment accounts have additional features for tracking holdings, trades, and cost basis. See [Managing Investment Accounts](./investment-accounts.mdx) for details.

### Crypto

Cryptocurrency holdings, either in:

| Subtype | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Wallet | Self-custody or provider-synced wallets |
| Exchange | Centralized exchanges with trade history |

> [!NOTE]
> Only exchange accounts support manual trade entry. Wallet accounts are sync-only.

### Property

Real estate you own:

| Subtype | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Single Family Home | Primary residence |
| Multi-Family Home | Duplex, triplex, etc. |
| Condominium | Condo unit |
| Townhouse | Townhouse property |
| Investment Property | Rental or investment real estate |
| Second Home | Vacation home |

Property accounts can track additional details like address, area (square footage), and year built.

### Vehicle

Cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other vehicles you own. Vehicle accounts can track make, model, year, and mileage.

### Other Asset

Anything else of value that doesn't fit the categories above:

- Collectibles (art, antiques, coins)
- Jewelry and watches
- Equipment
- Other valuables

## Liquid vs. Illiquid Assets

Sure distinguishes between liquid and illiquid assets:

**Liquid assets** can be quickly converted to cash without significant loss of value:
- Cash accounts (checking, savings)
- Most investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs)

**Illiquid assets** take time to sell or may lose value if sold quickly:
- Property
- Vehicles
- Some investments (private equity, real estate funds)
- Other assets (collectibles, jewelry)

This distinction helps you understand not just your total net worth, but how much of it you could access quickly if needed.

## How Assets Affect Net Worth

Your net worth is calculated as:

```
Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
```

Every asset account contributes positively to your net worth. When asset values increase (your investments grow, your home appreciates), your net worth increases. When you spend from asset accounts, that balance decreases—but the money likely went toward something (an expense, a purchase, or a debt payment).

> [!TIP]
> For a complete picture of your finances, make sure to add both your assets and your [debt accounts](./debt-accounts.mdx). Sure calculates your true net worth by subtracting what you owe from what you own.

## Adding Asset Accounts

To add an asset account:

1. Click **+ Add Account** on your dashboard
2. Select the asset type (Cash, Investment, Crypto, Property, Vehicle, or Other Asset)
3. Enter your account details:
   - Account name
   - Current balance
   - Subtype (if applicable)
4. Click **Create Account**

Your new asset account will appear in your accounts list and contribute to your net worth calculation immediately.
