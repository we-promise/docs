# Transfers Between Accounts

A transfer moves money between your own accounts. Unlike income or expenses, transfers don't change your net worth—they simply move funds from one place to another.

## How Transfers Work

Every transfer consists of two linked transactions:

1. **Outflow** - Money leaving one account (negative amount)
2. **Inflow** - Money entering another account (positive amount)

These two transactions are linked together as a single transfer.

### Example: Moving Money to Savings

When you transfer $500 from checking to savings:

| Account | Transaction | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checking | Outflow | -$500 |
| Savings | Inflow | +$500 |
| **Net Effect** | | **$0** |

Your total net worth stays the same—the money simply moved from one account to another.

## Transfer Types

Sure recognizes different types of transfers based on the destination account:

| Transfer Type | When It's Used | Budget Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Funds Movement** | Between asset accounts | Excluded |
| **CC Payment** | Payment to a credit card | Excluded |
| **Loan Payment** | Payment to a loan account | Treated as expense |
| **Investment Contribution** | To investment or crypto accounts | Excluded |

### Funds Movement

General transfers between asset accounts:
- Checking to savings
- Savings to money market
- Between investment accounts

These are excluded from budgets because they don't represent spending or income.

### Credit Card Payment

When you pay your credit card bill, Sure creates a `cc_payment` transfer:
- Outflow from your checking account
- Inflow to your credit card (reducing your debt)

This is excluded from budgets because the spending already happened when you used the credit card.

### Loan Payment

Payments to loan accounts (mortgage, auto, student loans) are treated as `loan_payment` transfers.

> [!NOTE]
> Loan payments can be treated as expenses in budgets since they represent an ongoing financial obligation, even though they also reduce your debt.

### Investment Contribution

Transfers to investment or crypto accounts:
- Contributing to your 401(k)
- Adding funds to a brokerage account
- Moving money to a crypto exchange

These are excluded from budgets because you're saving/investing, not spending.

## Creating Transfers Manually

To create a transfer:

1. Go to the **Transactions** page
2. Click **+ New Transaction**
3. Select **Transfer**
4. Choose:
   - **From account** - Where money is coming from
   - **To account** - Where money is going
   - **Amount** - How much to transfer
   - **Date** - When the transfer occurred
5. Click **Add transaction**

Sure automatically creates both the outflow and inflow transactions and links them together.

## Automatic Transfer Matching

When you sync accounts with a provider (Plaid, SimpleFIN, etc.), Sure attempts to automatically match transfers between accounts.

### How Matching Works

Sure looks for transaction pairs that:
- Are from different accounts in the same family
- Have opposite amounts (one positive, one negative)
- Occurred within a date window

### Date Windows

| Transaction Status | Window |
| --- | --- |
| Pending transactions | 4 days |
| Confirmed transactions | 30 days |

### Suggested Matches

When Sure finds a potential transfer match, it creates a **pending** transfer suggestion. You can:

1. **Confirm** - Accept the match and link the transactions
2. **Reject** - Dismiss the match (transactions remain separate)

To review suggested transfers:
1. Open a transaction that may be part of a transfer
2. Look for transfer match suggestions
3. Confirm or reject as appropriate

## Cross-Currency Transfers

When transferring between accounts with different currencies:

- Sure validates that amounts have opposite signs
- The exact amounts don't need to match (due to exchange rates)
- Both transactions are linked as a transfer

Example: Transferring from a USD checking account to a EUR savings account:

| Account | Currency | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| US Checking | USD | -$1,000 |
| Euro Savings | EUR | +€920 |

The transfer is valid because one amount is negative and one is positive, even though the numbers differ due to the exchange rate.

## How Transfers Affect Budgets

Transfers are generally **excluded** from budget calculations because they don't represent actual spending or income:

| Transfer Type | Budget Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Funds Movement | Excluded |
| CC Payment | Excluded |
| Investment Contribution | Excluded |
| Loan Payment | Can be included as expense |

> [!TIP]
> If you want to budget for loan payments, you may want to track them as expenses. Sure treats loan payments specially since they represent ongoing obligations.

## Understanding Net Worth Impact

Transfers are **zero-sum** for net worth:

- Moving $500 from checking to savings: Net worth unchanged
- Paying $500 to credit card: Net worth unchanged (reduced cash = reduced debt)
- Contributing $500 to 401(k): Net worth unchanged (reduced cash = increased investments)

The only time a transfer affects net worth is if there are fees involved (which would be a separate expense transaction).

## Common Transfer Scenarios

### Paying Off a Credit Card

1. Money leaves your checking account (-$500)
2. Credit card balance decreases (-$500 debt)
3. Net worth: unchanged

### Making a Mortgage Payment

1. Money leaves your checking account (-$2,000)
2. Loan balance decreases (-$1,700 principal, $300 goes to interest)
3. Note: The interest portion is technically an expense

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Mortgage payments include both principal (reducing debt) and interest (an expense). Sure tracks the full payment as a loan transfer, but the interest portion represents a true cost.

### Contributing to Retirement

1. Money leaves your checking account (-$500)
2. Investment account balance increases (+$500)
3. Net worth: unchanged (cash converted to investments)

### Transferring Between Banks

1. Money leaves Bank A checking (-$1,000)
2. Money arrives at Bank B checking (+$1,000)
3. Net worth: unchanged

## Troubleshooting Transfers

### Duplicate Transactions

If you see both a transfer and separate expense/income transactions:
- Check if the transactions should be linked as a transfer
- Confirm or reject the transfer suggestion
- Delete duplicate transactions if needed

### Unmatched Transfers

If Sure didn't automatically match a transfer:
- The amounts may not match exactly (due to fees or timing)
- The dates may be too far apart
- You can manually create a transfer to link them

### Wrong Transfer Type

If a transfer is categorized incorrectly:
- Check that both accounts are the correct type
- The transfer type is determined by the destination account
