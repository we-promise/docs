# Managing Investment Accounts

Investment accounts in Sure go beyond simple balance tracking. They help you understand your portfolio through holdings, trades, cost basis tracking, and investment activity labels.

## Understanding Holdings

A **holding** represents your position in a specific security. For example, if you own 50 shares of Apple stock, that's one holding.

Each holding tracks:

- **Security** - What you own (stock, ETF, mutual fund, crypto)
- **Quantity** - How many shares or units you hold
- **Price** - Current market price per share
- **Amount** - Total current value (quantity x price)
- **Cost Basis** - What you originally paid

## Securities Types

Sure supports various security types:

| Type | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Stocks | Individual company shares (AAPL, GOOGL) |
| ETFs | Exchange-traded funds (SPY, VTI) |
| Mutual Funds | Pooled investment funds |
| Crypto | Bitcoin, Ethereum, other cryptocurrencies |
| Bonds | Fixed-income securities |

## Cost Basis Tracking

Cost basis is the original purchase price of your investments. It's essential for:

- Calculating gains and losses
- Understanding investment performance
- Tax reporting

### Cost Basis Sources

Sure tracks cost basis from three sources, in order of priority:

| Priority | Source | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (Highest) | **Manual** | Values you enter directly |
| 2 | **Calculated** | Computed from your buy trades |
| 3 (Lowest) | **Provider** | Imported from your financial institution |

This hierarchy ensures your manual entries always take precedence, calculated values override provider data, and provider data is used when nothing else is available.

### Setting Cost Basis Manually

You can set cost basis in two ways:

**From the Holdings List:**

1. Navigate to your investment account
2. Find the holding in your portfolio
3. Click the pencil icon next to the average cost
4. Enter either:
   - **Total cost basis**: The total amount you paid for all shares
   - **Per-share cost**: The average price per share
5. Click **Save**

**From the Holding Drawer:**

1. Click on a holding to open its detail drawer
2. In the Overview section, click the pencil icon next to "Average Cost"
3. Enter the cost basis (total or per-share)
4. Click **Save**

> [!TIP]
> The cost basis editor provides real-time conversion between total and per-share values. Enter whichever format you have available, and Sure calculates the other automatically.

### Lock Protection

When you manually set a cost basis, Sure automatically **locks** it to prevent automatic updates from overwriting your value. You'll see a lock icon indicating the value is protected.

This ensures your manual entries remain intact during account syncs.

### Unlocking Cost Basis

If you want Sure to recalculate cost basis from your trades:

1. Open the holding drawer
2. Scroll to the **Settings** section
3. Find "Cost basis locked"
4. Click **Unlock**

After unlocking:
- The lock icon disappears
- Future syncs can update the cost basis
- Calculated values (from trades) will replace the manual value

## Investment Activity Labels

Activity labels help you classify investment transactions. They appear as badges in your transaction list and help you understand your investment activity at a glance.

### Available Activity Labels

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Buy** | Purchase of securities |
| **Sell** | Sale of securities |
| **Contribution** | Money added to the investment account |
| **Withdrawal** | Money removed from the investment account |
| **Dividend** | Dividend payments received |
| **Interest** | Interest earned |
| **Reinvestment** | Dividends or distributions reinvested |
| **Sweep In** | Cash swept into the account |
| **Sweep Out** | Cash swept out of the account |
| **Fee** | Account or transaction fees |
| **Exchange** | Currency or security exchanges |
| **Transfer** | Internal transfers |
| **Other** | Miscellaneous transactions |

### Setting Labels Manually

1. Open a transaction from an investment or crypto account
2. Scroll to the **Settings** section
3. Find "Activity type"
4. Select a label from the dropdown
5. The change saves automatically

### Setting Labels with Rules

Create rules to automatically label transactions based on patterns:

1. Go to **Settings > Rules**
2. Create a new rule
3. Set conditions (e.g., "IF transaction name contains 'DIVIDEND'")
4. Add action: "Set investment activity label"
5. Choose the label (e.g., "Dividend")
6. Save the rule

Example rules:
- IF name contains "DIVIDEND" THEN set label to "Dividend"
- IF name contains "INTEREST" THEN set label to "Interest"
- IF name contains "FEE" THEN set label to "Fee"

> [!NOTE]
> Internal movement labels (Transfer, Sweep In, Sweep Out, Exchange) are automatically excluded from budget calculations since they represent cash management rather than income or expenses.

## Tax Treatment Categories

Investment accounts have different tax implications based on their type:

| Category | Description | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Taxable** | Gains taxed when realized | Brokerage, UGMA/UTMA |
| **Tax-Deferred** | Taxes deferred until withdrawal | 401(k), Traditional IRA, 403(b) |
| **Tax-Exempt** | Qualified gains are tax-free | Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), ISA |
| **Tax-Advantaged** | Special tax benefits with conditions | 529 Plan, HSA |

Sure automatically assigns tax treatment based on account subtype, but you can adjust it manually if needed.

## Understanding Gains and Losses

Sure helps you track two types of gains:

### Unrealized Gains/Losses

Paper gains or losses on holdings you still own:

```
Unrealized Gain = Current Value - Cost Basis
```

If you bought 10 shares at $100 ($1,000 total) and they're now worth $1,200, you have an unrealized gain of $200.

### Realized Gains/Losses

Actual gains or losses from securities you've sold. These are what matter for taxes.

The **Trend** indicator on each holding shows your unrealized gain or loss, calculated from your cost basis. If cost basis is unknown (no trades and no manual entry), the trend won't display.

## Crypto-Specific Features

Crypto accounts work similarly to investment accounts but have unique characteristics:

| Subtype | Description | Manual Trades |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wallet | Self-custody or provider-synced | No |
| Exchange | Centralized exchanges (Coinbase, etc.) | Yes |

- **Exchange accounts** support manual trade entry, letting you record buys and sells
- **Wallet accounts** are sync-only—holdings are updated through provider connections

Crypto is taxable by default, though it can be held in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., self-directed IRA).

## Adding Investment Accounts

1. Click **+ Add Account** on your dashboard
2. Select **Investment** or **Crypto**
3. Choose the appropriate subtype (see [Account Types](./account-types.mdx) for all options)
4. Enter your account details:
   - Account name
   - Current balance
   - Tax treatment (if different from default)
5. Click **Create Account**

After creating the account, you can add holdings manually or connect a provider to sync them automatically.
