# How Debt Accounts Work

Debt accounts (also called liability accounts) track money you owe to others. This includes credit cards, loans, and any other obligations.

## Why Debt Math Seems "Backwards"

If you're used to thinking about asset accounts, debt accounts can feel counterintuitive at first. Here's the key difference:

| Balance Type | What It Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Positive balance** | You owe money |
| **Negative balance** | The lender owes you money (overpayment, refund) |

And transactions work in the opposite direction from assets:

| Action | Asset Account | Debt Account |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spend money | Balance decreases | Balance increases (more debt) |
| Receive money | Balance increases | Balance decreases (less debt) |

> [!TIP]
> Think of a debt balance as "Amount Owed" rather than "money I have." A higher number means you owe more, not that you have more.

## Credit Card Example

Let's walk through a typical credit card scenario:

| Action | Balance Change | New Balance | What It Means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starting balance | — | $500 | You owe $500 |
| Buy groceries (+$80) | +$80 | $580 | You now owe $580 |
| Gas purchase (+$45) | +$45 | $625 | You now owe $625 |
| Make payment (-$300) | -$300 | $325 | You now owe $325 |

Notice how spending **increases** the balance (you owe more) and payments **decrease** it (you owe less).

### Overpayment Scenario

What happens if you pay more than you owe?

| Action | Balance Change | New Balance | What It Means |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starting balance | — | $100 | You owe $100 |
| Make payment (-$150) | -$150 | -$50 | Card company owes you $50 |
| Buy coffee (+$5) | +$5 | -$45 | Card company owes you $45 |

A negative balance on a credit card means you've overpaid—the credit card company owes *you* money. This might happen from:

- Overpayment
- Refunds for returned purchases
- Statement credits or rewards

## Types of Debt Accounts

Sure supports three types of liability accounts:

### Credit Card

Track your credit card balances and spending. Credit card accounts can include:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| APR | Annual percentage rate (interest rate) |
| Available Credit | Remaining credit you can use |
| Minimum Payment | Minimum amount due |
| Annual Fee | Yearly card fee |

### Loan

Track mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and other installment debt.

| Subtype | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Mortgage | Home loan |
| Student | Student loan debt |
| Auto | Car loan |
| Other | Personal loans, etc. |

Loan accounts support additional fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Interest Rate | Annual interest rate |
| Rate Type | Fixed or variable rate |
| Term | Loan duration (months) |
| Monthly Payment | Calculated based on loan details |

> [!NOTE]
> For fixed-rate loans, Sure can calculate your monthly payment automatically based on the original balance, interest rate, and term.

### Other Liability

For debts that don't fit the above categories:

- Personal loans from friends/family
- Medical bills
- IOUs
- Tax obligations

## How Debt Affects Net Worth

Liabilities **reduce** your net worth:

```
Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
```

When you pay down debt, your net worth increases (even though your cash decreases). This is because the debt reduction outweighs the cash spent—you're converting a liquid asset (cash) into reduced liability (less debt).

### Example: Paying Off a Credit Card

| Account | Before Payment | After $500 Payment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checking (Asset) | $2,000 | $1,500 |
| Credit Card (Liability) | $500 | $0 |
| **Net Worth** | **$1,500** | **$1,500** |

Your net worth stays the same because you traded $500 of cash for $500 of debt reduction. But now you have no credit card debt!

## Adding Debt Accounts

To add a debt account:

1. Click **+ Add Account** on your dashboard
2. Select the liability type (Credit Card, Loan, or Other Liability)
3. Enter your account details:
   - Account name
   - Current balance (the amount you owe)
   - For loans: interest rate, term, and rate type
4. Click **Create Account**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to select a liability account type (Credit Card, Loan, or Other Liability) when adding debt. If you accidentally create a Cash account for your credit card, the balance calculations will be incorrect.

## Understanding Loan Payments

When you make a loan payment, the payment typically covers:

1. **Interest** - Cost of borrowing
2. **Principal** - Reducing the amount you owe

Sure tracks your loan balance, which represents the remaining principal. As you make payments, the balance decreases until the loan is paid off.

> [!TIP]
> To track loan payments accurately, create a [transfer](./transfers.mdx) from your checking account to your loan account. This properly reflects the payment in both accounts.
