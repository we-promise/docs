## Overview

The user management interface provides administrators with comprehensive tools to manage users, their connected SSO accounts, roles, and authentication settings. This includes viewing user details, managing connected accounts, manually adjusting roles, and troubleshooting authentication issues.

## Accessing user management

Navigate to the user management page in your admin dashboard:

```
https://your-domain.com/admin/users
```

## User list

The user list displays all users in the application with key information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | User's display name |
| Email | User's email address |
| Roles | Assigned application roles |
| Auth method | How the user authenticates (SSO provider or local) |
| Last login | Timestamp of most recent login |
| Status | Active, inactive, or suspended |
| Created | Account creation date |

### Filtering and search

Use the search and filter tools to find specific users:

- **Search**: Search by name, email, or username
- **Filter by role**: Show only users with specific roles
- **Filter by auth method**: Show users by authentication provider
- **Filter by status**: Show active, inactive, or suspended users
- **Sort**: Sort by any column (name, email, last login, etc.)

## User details

Click on a user to view detailed information:

### Basic information

- Full name
- Email address
- Username (if applicable)
- Profile picture
- Account creation date
- Last login timestamp
- Account status

### Connected accounts

View all SSO providers the user has connected:

| Provider | Connected | Last used | Actions |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Google | Yes | 2 hours ago | Disconnect |
| Okta SAML | Yes | 1 day ago | Disconnect |
| GitHub | No | - | - |

<Note>
Users can have multiple connected accounts from different SSO providers. They can log in using any connected provider.
</Note>

### Roles and permissions

View and manage the user's assigned roles:

- Current roles
- Role source (default, group mapping, or manual)
- Last role sync timestamp
- Manual role adjustments

### Authentication history

View recent authentication events:

- Login attempts (successful and failed)
- Provider used
- IP address
- Timestamp
- User agent

## Managing connected accounts

### Viewing connected accounts

For each user, you can see:
- Which SSO providers they've connected
- When each account was first connected
- When each account was last used for authentication
- Provider-specific user identifiers

### Disconnecting accounts

<Warning>
Disconnecting a user's only authentication method will prevent them from logging in. Ensure they have an alternative login method before disconnecting.
</Warning>

To disconnect an SSO account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to user details">
    Select the user from the user list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go to connected accounts">
    View the "Connected Accounts" section
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click disconnect">
    Click "Disconnect" next to the provider you want to remove
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm action">
    Confirm the disconnection in the dialog
  </Step>
</Steps>

The user will no longer be able to log in using that provider.

### Forcing reconnection

If a user is experiencing authentication issues with a specific provider:

1. Disconnect the problematic account
2. Ask the user to log in again using that provider
3. The account will be reconnected with fresh credentials

## Managing user roles

### Viewing role assignments

For each user, you can see:
- **Current roles**: All roles currently assigned
- **Role source**: How each role was assigned
  - `default`: From provider's default roles
  - `group_mapping`: From IdP group-to-role mapping
  - `manual`: Manually assigned by an administrator
- **Last sync**: When roles were last synchronized from IdP

### Manual role assignment

Override or supplement automatic role assignment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to user details">
    Select the user from the user list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go to roles section">
    View the "Roles & Permissions" section
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click edit roles">
    Click "Edit Roles" button
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add or remove roles">
    Select roles to add or remove from the user
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click "Save" to apply the role changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Manually assigned roles persist across logins and are not affected by role synchronization from IdP groups.
</Note>

### Syncing roles from IdP

Force a role synchronization from the identity provider:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to user details">
    Select the user from the user list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click sync roles">
    Click "Sync Roles from SSO" button
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm sync">
    Confirm the synchronization action
  </Step>
</Steps>

This fetches the latest group information from the user's identity provider and updates their roles based on current group-to-role mappings.

## User actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select user">
    Navigate to the user's detail page

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm suspension">
    Confirm the action in the dialog
  </Step>
</Steps>

Suspended users cannot log in until their account is reactivated.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm reactivation">
    Confirm the action
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting users

## Troubleshooting user issues

### User can't log in

**Problem**: User reports they cannot log in

**Steps to diagnose**:
1. Check user status (active, suspended, or deleted)
2. Review connected accounts - ensure they have at least one
3. Check authentication history for failed login attempts
4. Review audit logs for specific error messages
5. Verify the SSO provider is enabled and configured correctly

### User has wrong roles

**Problem**: User doesn't have expected permissions

**Steps to diagnose**:
1. Review current role assignments
2. Check role source (default, group mapping, or manual)
3. Verify group-to-role mappings in provider configuration
4. Check user's groups in the identity provider
5. Try syncing roles from SSO
6. Review audit logs for role change events

### Duplicate accounts

**Problem**: User has multiple accounts with different email addresses

**Solution**:
1. Identify the primary account to keep
2. Manually transfer any necessary data or permissions
3. Delete the duplicate account
4. Update the user's email in the identity provider if needed

### Connected account not working

**Problem**: User can't log in with a specific SSO provider

**Steps to diagnose**:
1. Check if the provider is enabled
2. Review provider configuration
3. Check authentication history for error messages
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the account
5. Verify the provider works for other users
6. Review audit logs for provider-specific errors
