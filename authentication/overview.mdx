description: Configure single sign-on authentication with OIDC, OAuth2, and SAML providers
---

## Overview

The application supports comprehensive single sign-on (SSO) authentication with multiple identity providers. You can configure authentication providers through either the admin UI or environment variables, supporting OIDC, OAuth2, and SAML 2.0 protocols.

## Key features

- **Multiple provider support**: Configure OIDC, OAuth2, and SAML 2.0 providers
- **Admin UI management**: Add, edit, and remove providers without server restarts
- **Database-backed configuration**: Store provider settings in the database for dynamic updates
- **Just-in-time provisioning**: Automatically create user accounts on first login
- **Role mapping**: Map identity provider groups to application roles
- **User management**: Admin interface for managing users and their connected accounts
- **Audit logging**: Track all SSO authentication events
- **RP-initiated logout**: Support for proper logout flows across identity providers

## Configuration methods

You can configure authentication providers using two methods:

### Database-backed providers (recommended)

Set the `AUTH_PROVIDERS_SOURCE` environment variable to enable database-backed provider configuration:

```bash
AUTH_PROVIDERS_SOURCE=database
```

With database-backed providers, you can manage all SSO configuration through the admin UI without requiring server restarts or configuration file changes.

### YAML-based providers (legacy)

If `AUTH_PROVIDERS_SOURCE` is not set or set to `yaml`, providers are configured through YAML configuration files. This method requires server restarts when making changes.

<Note>
We recommend migrating to database-backed providers for easier management and dynamic configuration updates.

## Supported protocols

### OIDC (OpenID Connect)

OIDC is the recommended protocol for modern identity providers. It provides:
- Standardized user profile information
- Built-in token validation
- Support for discovery endpoints

### OAuth2

OAuth2 provides flexible authentication with custom user profile endpoints. Use OAuth2 when:
- Your provider doesn't support OIDC
- You need custom user attribute mapping

### SAML 2.0

SAML 2.0 is commonly used in enterprise environments. It provides:
- XML-based authentication
- Support for enterprise identity providers
- Attribute-based user provisioning
