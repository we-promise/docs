description: Connect European bank accounts using PSD2 open banking
---

Enable Banking is a free third-party provider that allows you to connect European bank accounts to Sure using PSD2 open banking standards. It supports thousands of banks across the EU.

## How it works

Enable Banking uses the PSD2 open banking framework to securely access your bank data:

1. Select your bank from the list of supported institutions
2. Authorize Sure to access your account through your bank's authentication flow
3. Sure syncs your account balances and transactions
4. Data is refreshed periodically to keep your information current

All authentication happens directly with your bank. Enable Banking and Sure never see your banking credentials.

## Supported regions

Enable Banking supports banks across the European Union and EEA countries. You can query available banks by country code (e.g., "GB", "DE", "FR").

## Setting up Enable Banking

To connect your European bank accounts:

1. Obtain an Enable Banking application ID and client certificate from [Enable Banking](https://enablebanking.com/)
2. In Sure, configure your Enable Banking credentials
3. Select your country and bank from the available options
4. Complete the authorization flow with your bank
5. Sure will create a session and begin syncing your accounts
