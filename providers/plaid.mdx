<Warning>
Using Plaid for personal use might be against their terms of service. This integration is intended for technically savvy users who understand the implications and requirements.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Plaid integration currently only works for Western users. Plaid Production support is not available to European users.
</Warning>

<Note>
For Plaid integration, your Sure instance needs to be accessible from the internet behind a domain with working SSL. See additional context in [maybe-finance/maybe#2419](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/pull/2419).
</Note>

Plaid is a US-focused banking provider that offers comprehensive account connectivity. However, it requires significant technical setup and may not be suitable for personal use according to their terms of service.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Plaid:

- Your Sure instance must be publicly accessible via HTTPS
- You need a valid domain with working SSL certificate
