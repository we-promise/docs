Lunch Flow is a paid third-party provider that offers global bank account connectivity. It's the recommended option for users who need to connect accounts from multiple countries or regions outside the EU and US.

## How it works

Lunch Flow provides a unified API to access bank accounts across different countries and financial institutions:

1. Obtain a Lunch Flow API key
2. Configure the API key in Sure
3. Sure syncs your accounts, balances, and transactions
4. Data is refreshed automatically to keep information current

## Global coverage

Lunch Flow supports financial institutions worldwide, making it ideal for:

- Users with accounts in multiple countries
- Regions not covered by Enable Banking or SimpleFIN
- International banking needs

## Setting up Lunch Flow

To connect your bank accounts:

1. Sign up for a Lunch Flow account at [lunchflow.app](https://lunchflow.app/)
2. Generate an API key from your Lunch Flow dashboard
3. In Sure, add your Lunch Flow API key
4. Sure will automatically discover and sync your connected accounts

## Pricing

Lunch Flow is a paid service. Check [lunchflow.app](https://lunchflow.app/) for current pricing information.

## Configuration

### Pending transactions

You can configure Lunch Flow to include pending transactions in your syncs. Pending transactions are those that have been authorized but haven't yet posted to your account.

To enable pending transactions, set the following environment variable:

```bash
LUNCHFLOW_INCLUDE_PENDING=1
```

When enabled, transactions marked as pending by Lunch Flow will be imported and displayed with a "Pending" badge in the UI.

### Debug mode

For troubleshooting, you can enable debug logging to see the raw API responses:

```bash
LUNCHFLOW_DEBUG_RAW=1
```

## Limitations

- Requires a paid Lunch Flow subscription
- Subject to Lunch Flow API rate limits
- Holdings data not available for all account types
- Coverage varies by country and institution
