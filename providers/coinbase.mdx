description: Connect your Coinbase account to track cryptocurrency holdings and transactions
---

Coinbase integration allows you to sync your cryptocurrency accounts, track holdings, and monitor transactions directly in Sure using the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) API.

<Note>
This integration is currently in beta. Please report any issues you encounter.
</Note>

## How it works

When you connect your Coinbase account, Sure syncs:

- Account balances across multiple cryptocurrencies
- Trading history and transactions
- Holdings with real-time valuations
- Native currency support (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)

The integration supports both cryptocurrency balances and fiat currency accounts linked to your Coinbase profile.

## Prerequisites

To use the Coinbase integration, you need:

- An active Coinbase account
- Coinbase CDP API credentials (API key and API secret)

## Getting your API credentials

1. Log in to your [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/) account
2. Navigate to Settings → API
3. Create a new API key with the following permissions:
   - View account information
   - View transaction history
   - View balances
4. Save your API key and API secret securely

<Warning>
Your API secret is only shown once. Store it securely - you'll need both the API key and secret to connect Sure.
</Warning>

## Connecting Coinbase to Sure

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Providers** in Sure
2. Click **Add Provider** and select **Coinbase**
3. Enter your API credentials:
   - **API Key**: Your Coinbase API key
   - **API Secret**: Your Coinbase API secret
4. Click **Connect**

## Account linking

After connecting, Sure will discover all your Coinbase accounts. You'll need to link each Coinbase account to a Sure account:

1. Review the list of discovered Coinbase accounts
2. For each account you want to track:
   - Select an existing Sure account, or
   - Create a new account to link it to
3. Click **Save** to complete the linking
