---


CoinStats is a third-party provider that allows you to sync cryptocurrency wallet balances and transactions into Sure. This integration uses the CoinStats OpenAPI to fetch data from multiple blockchain networks.

## How it works

When you connect a crypto wallet through CoinStats, Sure syncs:

- Wallet balances across multiple tokens
- Transaction history
- Real-time price data

The integration supports multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum, Bitcoin, and many others available through CoinStats.

## Currency storage approach

All CoinStats accounts are stored in **USD** and will remain in USD. This design decision ensures data consistency and prevents exchange rate drift.

### Why USD storage?

There are two possible approaches for storing cryptocurrency values:

**Option 1: Store in USD (current implementation)**

- CoinStats data is stored in USD
- Values are converted to your family currency when displayed
- Works the same way as multi-currency accounts already do in Sure
- If you update exchange rates, values automatically update correctly without requiring a sync
- Original USD values are always preserved

**Option 2: Store in family currency**

- Convert cryptocurrency values to family currency during sync
- **Problem**: If currency provider is not set up or conversion fails, data is saved with a 1:1 exchange rate
- Once saved incorrectly, you lose the original value and cannot fix it later
- Creates data integrity issues

### Benefits of USD storage

The USD storage approach provides several advantages:

1. **No forex drift**: Values are converted only once, preventing cumulative exchange rate errors
2. **Data integrity**: Original values are always preserved
3. **Automatic updates**: When you fix or update exchange rates, all cryptocurrency values update correctly without re-syncing
4. **Consistency**: Works the same way as other multi-currency accounts in Sure
5. **Reliability**: No dependency on currency provider being available during sync

This is why USD storage is the preferred approach and will remain the standard for CoinStats integration.

## Setting up CoinStats

To connect your cryptocurrency wallets:

1. Get a CoinStats API key from [CoinStats](https://coinstats.app/)
2. In Sure, navigate to account settings
3. Add a new CoinStats connection
4. Enter your API key
5. Select the blockchain networks and wallet addresses you want to sync

Once connected, Sure will automatically sync your wallet balances and transactions.

## Supported features
