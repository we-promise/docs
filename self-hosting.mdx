title: Self-hosting with Docker
description: Deploy Sure on your own infrastructure using Docker Compose
---

This guide shows you how to set up, update, and maintain a self-hosted Sure application with Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine installed and running
- Basic familiarity with the command line

## Installation

### Install Docker

1. Follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Start the Docker service on your machine
3. Verify the installation:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If Docker is set up correctly, this command will succeed.

### Create your application directory

Create a directory where your app will run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/docker-apps/sure
cd ~/docker-apps/sure
```

### Download the Docker Compose file

Download the sample compose file from the Sure repository:

```bash
curl -o compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/we-promise/sure/main/compose.example.yml
```

This creates a `compose.yml` file in your current directory with the default configuration.

## Configuration

By default, the `compose.example.yml` file runs without any configuration. For production deployments or if you're running outside of a local network, follow these steps to add security.

### Create an environment file

Create a `.env` file where Docker will read environment variables:

```bash
touch .env
```

### Generate a secret key

Generate a secret key using one of these methods:

**With OpenSSL:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 64
```

**Without OpenSSL:**
```bash
head -c 64 /dev/urandom | od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' \n' && echo
```

Save the generated key for the next step.

### Configure environment variables

Open the `.env` file in your text editor and add:

```txt
SECRET_KEY_BASE="your-generated-secret-key-here"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="your-database-password-here"
```

Replace the placeholder values with your generated secret key and a secure database password.

## Running the application

### Start the application

Start the app to verify everything is working:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This pulls the official Docker image and starts the app. You'll see logs in your terminal.

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Sure login screen.

### Create your account

On first run, register a new account:

1. Click "Create your account" on the login page
2. Enter your email
3. Enter a password

### Run in the background

To run Sure in the background:

1. Stop the current process with `Ctrl+C`
2. Start in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Verify it's running:

```bash
docker compose ls
```

Your app is now accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Updating

The Docker image in your `compose.yml` file controls which version of Sure you're running:

```yml
image: ghcr.io/we-promise/sure:latest
```

### Recommended images

- `ghcr.io/we-promise/sure:latest` - Latest alpha release
- `ghcr.io/we-promise/sure:stable` - Latest stable release

You can also pin to a specific version from the [packages page](https://github.com/we-promise/sure/pkgs/container/sure).

### Update to the latest version

Your app does not automatically update. To update:

```bash
cd ~/docker-apps/sure
docker compose pull
docker compose build
docker compose up --no-deps -d web worker
```

### Change update channel

To switch between update channels, edit the `compose.yml` file:

```yml
image: ghcr.io/we-promise/sure:stable
```

Then restart the app:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose build
docker compose up --no-deps -d web worker
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database connection errors

If you encounter `ActiveRecord::DatabaseConnectionError` on first startup, Docker may have initialized the Postgres database with a different default role from a previous attempt.

<Warning>
The following commands will delete all existing data in your Sure database. Only proceed if you're comfortable losing this data.
</Warning>

Reset the database:

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume rm sure_postgres-data
docker compose up
docker compose exec db psql -U sure_user -d sure_development -c "SELECT 1;"
```

The last command verifies the issue is fixed.

### Slow CSV imports

If CSV imports are processing rows slower than expected, check your worker logs for errors:

```bash
docker compose logs worker
```

Look for connection timeouts or Redis communication failures. The `sure-worker` container requires Redis to process CSV imports.
